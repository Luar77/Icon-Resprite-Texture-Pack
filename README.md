# Project Remix Texture Pack (version 1.0.0-alpha)
Texture pack collab, featuring over 30 people, that took over 9 months to finish.
Every icon in the game has been remade from scratch in the styles of everyone who participated.

This was hosted on the [Master's World discord server](https://discord.gg/tFUyJw5), with organization provided via the Jones Bot by Luar77 (which took just as long to develop), and quality assurance/project management by the admin team (ML500, Luar77, Sorao).

Credits for each individual icon are listed in the README.md provided in the pack itself.

## Sponsors
Apparently some people were really insisting on helping with the development costs of the bot (electricity bill), so, as a thanks, they're being listed here, since that's all I can really do (seriously y'all did not have to donate anything)
- Dibbj (50€ donation)
- JigglypuffGD ($20 donation)
